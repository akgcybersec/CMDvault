# Security Policy for CMDvault

This document explains how to report security issues in **CMDvault** and the expectations around responsible disclosure.

## Supported versions

CMDvault is a personal/open-source project. The latest version in the main branch is considered the supported version.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in CMDvault or its configuration:

- **Do not** open a public GitHub issue describing the vulnerability.
- Instead, contact the maintainer **privately**:
  - **Email:** `aswinkgopan@gmail.com`

Please include, when possible:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Any affected configuration or environment details
- Suggested impact (what an attacker could achieve)

## Handling process

1. Your report will be acknowledged as soon as reasonably possible.
2. The issue will be investigated and validated.
3. A fix or mitigation will be prepared if the issue is confirmed.
4. Once a fix is available, details of the issue may be disclosed, if appropriate.

## Scope and expectations

- CMDvault is intended for **authorized penetration testing and security research only**.
- Do **not** use CMDvault or any related tooling against systems you do not own or administer, without explicit permission.
- Do **not** test against third-party infrastructure without their consent.

## Non-vulnerability issues

For general bugs, feature requests, or usability problems that are **not** security vulnerabilities, please open a normal GitHub issue instead of using the email above.
