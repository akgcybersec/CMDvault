# Contributing to CMDvault

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **CMDvault**.

This project is a personal command and notes vault for penetration testers. Please keep ethics, security, and privacy in mind when contributing.

## Ways to contribute

- Fix bugs or usability issues
- Improve UI/UX and accessibility
- Add or improve documentation
- Refine tags, placeholders, and command organisation
- Suggest or implement small features that improve workflow

If you plan a **larger feature**, please open an issue first so we can discuss scope and design.

## Getting started

1. **Fork** the repository: https://github.com/akgcybersec
2. **Create a branch** for your change:
   - `git checkout -b feature/short-description`
3. Make your changes.
4. Ensure the app builds and runs locally.
5. **Commit** with a clear message:
   - `feat: add xyz`
   - `fix: correct abc`
6. **Open a pull request** with:
   - A short summary of the change
   - Any screenshots (for UI changes)
   - Notes on potential impact or migration

## Code style

- Keep the existing stack and structure (Next.js, TypeScript, SQLite).
- Match existing naming and formatting patterns.
- Prefer small, focused pull requests over large ones.

## Security & ethics

- Do **not** contribute content that encourages illegal or unethical activity.
- Commands and examples must assume **legal, authorized** penetration testing only.
- Do not submit real secrets, tokens, or sensitive data in examples or tests.

If you are unsure whether a contribution is appropriate, open an issue and ask.

If you find a security vulnerability in CMDvault, **do not** open a public issue.
